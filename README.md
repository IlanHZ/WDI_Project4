#Mappers

A travel app developped in a MEAN Stack, Google Maps API and Web Sockets.

<h3>Concept </h3>

The concept is that the user can “draw” on the map the journey he wants to undertake and the app will
immediately show him all the events (the Adventures) created by the Community of users and all the users with their 
live location, within a specific perimeter in the “road” the user has drawn.

In this way, the user can know exactly what is happening live in every part of the world, 
get in touch with people out there (with a private and a global chat made with Web Sockets) and plan his trip with the best information.
